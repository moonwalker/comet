- Projects requiring built-in secrets management
- Organizations wanting full control

### Terragrunt

**Philosophy:** DRY Terraform wrapper with dependency management

**Strengths:**
- Very mature and battle-tested
- Large community
- Excellent dependency management
- Great documentation
- Works with any Terraform module

**Weaknesses:**
- HCL + YAML can be verbose
- Learning curve for advanced features
- No built-in secrets management
- Configuration can become complex

**Best for:**
- Most teams and projects
- Organizations wanting proven solutions
- Teams comfortable with HCL
- Projects needing strong community support

### Atmos

**Philosophy:** Enterprise framework with extensive patterns
