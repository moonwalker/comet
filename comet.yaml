# Environment variables loaded before every command
# NOTE: Shell environment variables take precedence over these
# WARNING: Using op:// or sops:// references here can be slow (3-5s per secret)
#          as they are resolved on EVERY comet command (plan, apply, list, etc.)
#          Consider setting frequently-used secrets in your shell instead:
#            export SOPS_AGE_KEY=$(op read "op://vault/item/field")
# env:
#   EXAMPLE_VAR: "plain-value"
#   SLOW_SECRET: "op://vault/item/field"  # ⚠️  Adds ~4s to every command!
